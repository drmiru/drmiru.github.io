<p>As I first noticed this behavior in March 2012 I didnâ€™t expect to have a support case with Citrix, Microsoft and Appsense for about 6 months duration. The behavior affects services and applications implemented as network credential providers on a XenApp host. Usually they get launched by MPNotify which is spawned by Winlogon upon a correct and regognized logon method. But MPNotify was never kicked off when using Kerberos or Kerberos Pass-through logon method on XenApp servers. So in my case this affected the Appsense Environment Manager on the XenApp hosts, because the agent runs under LOCALSYSTEM and uses a credential provider for impersonation. So long story in short words.. Appsense EM was off the game when using Kerberos logon method on XA session hosts.</p>
