I"æ<p>This might be very useful for certain situations where you want to update a userâ€™s or computerâ€™s group membership without the need to re-logon / restart. The whole magic is behind the issued kerberos tickets after you logged on to a machine or a machineÂ has been started. The tool â€œklist.exeâ€ cannot only be usedÂ for troubleshooting to display theÂ current issued TGT / TGS, it is also capable to purge all current tickets. The purge command results in a re-issuance of theÂ tickets, as soon as the next auth or service requestÂ is taking place. Keep in mind that this method only works for services which authenticate via Kerberos. NTLM based authentication still requires a fresh logon with updated group membership token.</p>
