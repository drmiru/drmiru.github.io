I"è<p>Just coming back from a strange troubleshooting session where an application running on an AKS Cluster was not responding anymore after a network architecture change. It turned out quickly, that the root cause had to be searched in the recent configuration change. The change included a new routing configuration in the customers Azure global network. The AKS cluster‚Äôs network has been peered with a new hub network. The hub network is located in SwitzerlandNorth region whereas the AKS application vnet is located in WestEurope. So we have created a so called cross-region or ‚Äúglobal‚Äù vnet peering. <figure class="wp-block-image"></figure></p>
