I"Ë<p>Although Service Management Automation is IMHO the future of automation and orchestration, it has some downsides compared to the graphical editor capabilities of System Center Orchestrator. I assume that the next version of SMA, will address at least some of the missing features. In the meantime the community starts developing own solutions to make SMA runbook management a bit easier, especially when dealing with lot of runbooks and workflow code.</p>
