I"ß<p>As I first noticed this behavior in March 2012 I didnâ€™t expect to have a support case with Citrix, Microsoft and Appsense for about 6 months duration. The behavior affects services and applications implemented as network credential providers on a XenApp host. Usually they get launched by MPNotify which is spawned by Winlogon upon a correct and regognized logon method. But MPNotify was never kicked off when using Kerberos or Kerberos Pass-through logon method on XenApp servers. So in my case this affected the Appsense Environment Manager on the XenApp hosts, because the agent runs under LOCALSYSTEM and uses a credential provider for impersonation. So long story in short words.. Appsense EM was off the game when using Kerberos logon method on XA session hosts.</p>

<p>Citrix has now published a hotfix for XenApp where MPNotify gets spawned correctly on Kerberos logons.</p>

<p>Hotfix for XenApp 6.0 HRP1<br />
<a href="http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX134317" target="_blank">http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX134317</a></p>

<p>Hotfix for XenApp 6.5 HRP1<br />
The HF for XA6.5 HRP01 has not been published yet. You might call Citrix Support to get the private or wait a few weeks till it has been officially released cauz Iâ€™m not allowed to share the private at this time.</p>

<p>! For Appsense EM you need the most recent version <strong>8.3.232.0</strong> which also includes a fix required for the issue mentioned above.</p>

<p>Happy Kerberos-ing â€¦ ðŸ™‚</p>
