I"(<p>Back in the days, my first <a href="http://www.e2evc.com/home/">E2EVC</a> (formerly called PubForum) in 2005 was already a great event having smart people discussing technical related stuff around server based computing. The attendee count was around 30 while nowadays, we have around 120 attendees on each event, which kicks off twice a year. This time we met in Rome (Italy) and, weâ€™ve had attendees from 18 countries, including 18 MVPs, 15 CTPs and 6 vExperts. This has been the 20<sup>th</sup> event since the initial launch 10 years ago.</p>
