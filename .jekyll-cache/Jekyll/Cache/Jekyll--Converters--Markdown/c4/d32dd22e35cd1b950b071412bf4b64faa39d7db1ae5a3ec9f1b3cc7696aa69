I"‰<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Update!: Regardless of the fact that the method described below still works for Windows 2012 incl. Domain Controllers, it is not a supported way and you use it at your own risk.</strong></span></p>

<p>There are several ways to reset a local admin password. The one I‚Äôm posting here is one of the simplest one, and YES!, it works for a domain admin password too! So I think you‚Äôll gonna think about your physical server storage and access security again after you‚Äôve read this post.</p>

<p>So how that works?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a windows bootable installation media (physical or ISO)</li>
  <li>Choose Language</li>
  <li>Choose ‚ÄúRepair‚Äù option</li>
  <li>Choose instance of windows to repair</li>
  <li>Select ‚Äúcommand prompt‚Äù as recovery option</li>
  <li>Change to %systemdrive%\Windows\System32</li>
  <li>Rename utilman.exe to utilman.exe.orig</li>
  <li>copy cmd.exe to utilman.exe</li>
  <li>Reboot from local disk</li>
  <li>At the logon prompt Press ‚ÄúWindows-Key ‚Äì U‚Äù (this opens a command prompt</li>
  <li>net user administrator MyNewDamnPassword</li>
  <li>Logon with your new password</li>
  <li>Delete utilman.exe and rename utilman.exe.orig back to utilman.exe</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprised? Shocked? Don‚Äôt mind about tricks like this one, but think about your servers physical placement and who has access to them!<br />
(and of course in a virtual world you might think about who can mount a ISO to VM and boot it¬† from that)</p>
