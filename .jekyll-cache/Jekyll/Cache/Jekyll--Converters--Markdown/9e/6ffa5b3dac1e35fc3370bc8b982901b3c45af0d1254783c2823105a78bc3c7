I"7<p>Powershell provides easy replace and split method to manipulate text/string values. They are easy to use but…if you want to replace content only on subsequent positions or split a string using a pattern containing more than a single character, you’ll fail.</p>

<p>Let’s take two examples.<br />
Replace the last IP digit</p>

<pre>$a = 'The IP Adress with the number 100 is: 192.168.1.100'
$a.replace('100','101')</pre>

<p>if you just had to replace the IP digit but not the text before, you have a problem.</p>

<p>The same for split.</p>

<pre>$a = 'This is a combined string :which we want to split from here: and the show begins:'
$a.split('from here:')</pre>

<p>The split method does only allow a single character as a split string.</p>

<p>To enhance this two methods take these two regex examples as a reference.</p>

<pre>[Regex]::Replace('192.168.1.200', '\d{1,3}$','201')
[Regex]::Split('http://server1/dir/subdir/','\bhttp://')</pre>

<p>As you can see, the regex pattern function works also for split and replace methods within complex string content</p>
