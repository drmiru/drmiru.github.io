I"<p>As last year, November 2015 will be a very busy month. Beside lot of customer projects all around private- and hybrid Cloud deployments, first stop on my road trip is Seattle. During the week of 1<em>st</em> to 06<em>th</em> of October Iâ€™m honored to join the annual MVP Summit in Redmond.</p>

<p><a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/Summit" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-4342" src="http://www.miru.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mvpsummit15-1024x264.jpg" alt="mvpsummit15" width="1024" height="264" srcset="http://www.miru.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mvpsummit15-1024x264.jpg 1024w, http://www.miru.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mvpsummit15-300x77.jpg 300w, http://www.miru.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mvpsummit15.jpg 1593w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>

<p>For those who donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about, the global <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/Summit" target="_blank">MVP Summit</a>Â is a week full of deep dive material, sessions and personal meetings with Microsoft Product Groups Leads and Program Managers. The session schedule looks awesome and Iâ€™m really looking forward to get the latest and greatest insights on future product releases as well as deep dive feedback discussions on current releases with the product teams and my fellow MVPs from all over the world. The whole PG organization as well as the MVP leads are putting a huge amount of effort into this event, which is IMHO a â€œgive backâ€ to us MVPs, spending lots of our spare time to dig into issues and real world deployments and sharing them with the community.</p>

<p>After coming back from WA and hopefully overcoming the beloved jet lag, I will move to Lisbon, joining and speaking at the E2E Virtualization Conference. This time again with my co-worker and fellow MVP <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasMaurer" target="_blank">Thomas Maurer</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnerStefan" target="_blank">Stefan Johner</a>, SME for SCSM and <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanroth_net" target="_blank">Stefan Roth</a>, CDM MVP will also join and speak, so fun is programmed ğŸ™‚</p>
