I"Ç<p>Itâ€™s common to create and dispose / delete lots of virtual machine in an automated private cloud. SCVMM comes with itâ€™s own implementation of a tiny DHCP-Server like service. The feature allows the assignment of IP addresses from a pool to deployed virtual machines. SCVMM tracks the assignments by adding them as â€œAllocatedIPAddressâ€ object types. SCVMM R2 together with Server 2012 R2 will allow an integrated IP address management using IPAM extensions for SCVMM. For now we have to manage it ourselves.</p>

<p>The following script searches for assigned IP addresses where the virtual network adapter the address has been assigned to does not exist any more. Each orphaned IP is then returned back to itâ€™s Pool.</p>

<pre>#Importing SCVMM Module
Import-Module VirtualMachineManager

$assignedIPs = Get-SCIpaddress
Foreach ($ip in $assignedIPs)
{
Â Â Â  $assignedNIC = Get-SCVirtualNetworkAdapter -ID $ip.AssignedToId -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Â Â Â  If (!$assignedNIC)
Â Â Â  {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  "$($ip.Name) returned IP to Pool $($ip.AllocatingAddressPool)"
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  $ip | Revoke-SCIPAddress -ReturnToPool $true
Â Â Â  }
}</pre>

<p>Â </p>

<p>If you like to run the script based on a schedule why not use a Powershell Scheduled Job?</p>

<pre>$dailyTrigger = New-JobTrigger -Daily -At "5:00 AM"
Register-ScheduledJob -Name ReturnSCIPaddresses -ScriptBlock {D:\Scripts\ReturnUnusedPoolIPAddresses.ps1} -Trigger $dailyTrigger}</pre>

<p>Â </p>
