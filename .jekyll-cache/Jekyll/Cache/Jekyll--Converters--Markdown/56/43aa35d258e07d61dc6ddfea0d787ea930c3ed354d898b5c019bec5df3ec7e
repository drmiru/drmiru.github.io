I"È<p>Extending Cluster Shared Volumes is a common task which is required from time to time. Although my favorite action is to create a new volume if existing ones lack in free space, sometimes thereâ€™s no way around extending an existing volume. Iâ€™m really happy Microsoft did listen on our feedback we provided on Storage Replica, in the early stages of Server 2016 TP version, where we yelled for the feature (online-extending a replicated volume).</p>
