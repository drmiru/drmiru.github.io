<p>This year has been a busy one already, but more to come up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>After speaking at various TechNet events in the beginning of the year, I spoke at <a href="http://www.e2evc.com/home/" target="_blank">E2EVC</a> this spring together with fellow Thomas Maurer on “<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/drmiru/e2evc-2014-building-clouds-with-microsoft-cloud-os-and-system-center" target="_blank">How to create a Microsoft Private Cloud</a>” using the Cloud OS and the System Center solution stack.</li>
  <li>During the winter season I wrote <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Service-Management-fcd75828" target="_blank">whitepaper on SMA</a>, covering the new automation flagship “Service Management Automation”. The <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Service-Management-fcd75828" target="_blank">pape</a>r has become a huge success, which I did not think of when I wrote it.</li>
  <li>In May I joined <a href="http://www.itnetx.ch/" target="_blank"><strong>itnetx</strong></a>, a swiss SI for Microsoft Cloud and Workplace solutions and Microsoft Partner of the Year for past 3 years</li>
  <li>In June I was invited to have a guest speach at the Austrian System Center User Group on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/drmiru/service-management-automation-sma-from-zero-to-hero" target="_blank">SMA “from zero to hero”</a>.</li>
  <li>In July a was awarded as a Microsoft <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview.aspx" target="_blank">MVP for Cloud and Datacenter Management</a> (no need to explain what this means to me)</li>
  <li>In September I was honored to present two session at <a href="http://www.systemcenteruniverse.ch/" target="_blank">System Center Universe Europe</a> in Basel (CH). One session on SMA together with fellow MVP Markus Klein , the other session on SDS / Storage Spaces together with fellow MVP Carsten Rachfahl.  You can watch the session on channel9.</li>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="the-next-upcoming-speaches-are">The next upcoming speaches are…</h3>

<ul>
  <li>“Deep Dive into Microsoft’s Software defined Storage Stack” at <a href="http://www.e2evc.com/home/" target="_blank">E2eVC Barcelona</a> (24th – 26th October)</li>

</ul>

<p>The highlight of this year will be the <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/summit.aspx" target="_blank">MVP Summit</a> in November, kicking off at Microsoft HQ in Redmond. Around 1200 MVPs will meet, network and exchange information together with the Microsoft leads and PMs. I’m really looking forward to meet a lot of nice and skilled people in person.</p>

<p>Hope to see you on one of the upcoming events!</p>
