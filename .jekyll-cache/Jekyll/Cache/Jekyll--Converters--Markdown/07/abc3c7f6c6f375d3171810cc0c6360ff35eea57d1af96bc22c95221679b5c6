I"ú<p>I recently came along some issues while trying to import previously exported or copied virtual machines for a customer. The recent admin did not document what he tried to do so far, but several of the virtual machines where in a likely ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äù state. Importing those VMs using the Hyper-V Manager GUI or Powershell CMDLETS failed with different errors, but all pointed to the same root causes.</p>
