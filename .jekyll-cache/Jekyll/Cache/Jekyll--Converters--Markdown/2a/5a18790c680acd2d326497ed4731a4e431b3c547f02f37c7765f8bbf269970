I"0<p>A lot of people are still using VLAN based isolation for their Software defined Network in System Center Virtual Machine Manager. Although you have 4096 VLanIDs to assign, sometimes things have to be changed. Did you ever try to change a Subnet or VLANId on a Logical Network Site that is in use?</p>
