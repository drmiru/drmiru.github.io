I"9<p>Trying to install Exchange 2010 SP1 on 2008 R2 was not that easy as I thought. Everything but the CAS role could be installed.<br />
After installing latest windows patches setup asked always for two additional hotfixes while checking prerequisites for CAS role. Google and MS KB showed up weird results..</p>
