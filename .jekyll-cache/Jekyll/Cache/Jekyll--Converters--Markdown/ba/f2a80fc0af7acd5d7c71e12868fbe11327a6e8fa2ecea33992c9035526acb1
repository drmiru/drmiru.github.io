I"£<p>The traditional Windows BSOD has turned into a rarely occuring phenomen, sometimes you might see still see it. Didn‚Äôt you crossed your hands over your head and thought‚Ä¶ What the f*** shall I do with this information on the bluescreen?<br />
I‚Äôve collected some useful links which will help you to get a knowledge of analyzing crash dumps (system and application crashes). Finally it shows you which component was responsible to crash your system / application.<br />
An important note here:<br />
MOST of¬†user executed applications can‚Äôt be responsible for a system crash cause they are executed in the user mode of the operating system memory. So mainly kernel mode sw/hw drivers are causing your winbox to show a BSOD. Instead of asking your users, ‚Äúwhich application did you start before it crashed?‚Äù you better have a look into the following pages and make yourself fit in basics of crash dump analysis. A special thank here to Mark Russinovich, Dmitri Vostokov and Lalit Kaushal¬†for sharing their tremendous knowledge about this stuff.</p>
