I"®	<p>In this article Iâ€™d like to give an example on how to automate an online extension of a Cluster Shared Volume on a remote Server (Cluster Node).</p>

<p>Before youâ€™re going to kill your Failover Cluster, please consider that the following snippets and commands assume thatâ€¦. <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br /> </span></p>

<ul>
  <li>You know, what youâ€™re doing</li>
  <li>You hopefully named your Cluster Shared Volumes identically to the logical volume names</li>
  <li>You increased already the physical disk size of your CSV</li>
  <li>You installed the Powershell Failover Cluster Management Tools (<span style="font-family: Consolas;">Add-WindowsFeature RSAT-Clustering-Powershell</span>)</li>
  <li>You enabled and configured WinRM on all of the Cluster Nodes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>First we have to get the current owner of the CSV</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$volume_name = "CSV1"
$cluster_name = "hvcluster2"
$csv_owner = (Get-ClusterSharedVolume -Cluster $cluster_name | ? {$_.Name -eq "CSV1"}).OwnerNode.name 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Â </p>

<p>**Now letâ€™s get the Volume ID from Diskpart Output<br />
**</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$volume = Invoke-Command -ComputerName $csv_owner -ScriptBlock {"list volume" | diskpart} | Select-String $volume_name | Select-String -Pattern '[0-9]{1,3}'
$volume_id = $matches[0] 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Here comes the tricky part. As there is currently no CMDLET to extend a volume (if there is any please ping me) I had to use old fashion DISKPART command.<br />
With the Volume ID we got from the previous command, weâ€™re going to invoke the remote DISKPART command for volume extension</strong></p>

<pre class="crayon-selected">Invoke-Command -ComputerName $csv_owner -ScriptBlock {"RESCAN","SELECT VOLUME $($args[0])","EXTEND"| diskpart} -Args $volume_id</pre>

<p>There are of course also other ways and simplifications to the code above, but to keep it readable I did not combine all steps. It would be really nice if we had a Powershell CMDLET for Logical Volume Extension to get rid of old fashioned DISKPART. Other DISKPART commands can be easily replaced with CMDLETs. Have a look for a some examples within the <a href="http://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2012/04/replace-diskpart-with-windows-powershell-basic-storage-cmdlets/">post of Thomas Maurer</a>.</p>
