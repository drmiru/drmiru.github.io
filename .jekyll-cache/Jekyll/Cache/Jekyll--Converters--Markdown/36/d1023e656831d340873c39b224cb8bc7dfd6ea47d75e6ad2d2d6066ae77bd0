I"ã<p>Deleting a Logical Network within VMM can be painful if itâ€™s already configured end-to-end, meaning all components plugged together and Hyper-V Hosts equipped with a Logical Switch accordingly. If youâ€™re not an expert on how the different components are plumbed together, youâ€™ll probably waste a lot of time digging the various dependencies. To save also time for my own while playing in LAB and Demo environments I created a little Powershell script that does all the work for me. It performs the following steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gather dependency information from Logical Networks, Network Sites, IP Pools, VM Networks, Uplink Port Profiles and Logical Switches relying on the Logical Network to be deleted</li>
  <li>Delete the components in the correct order</li>
</ul>

<p>The Script fully supports the <strong>-whatif p</strong>arameter, so you can see what the script would delete, before you screw up yourÂ SDN ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>I decided to remove the Logical SwitchÂ the Logical Network belongs to from all affected Hyper-V Hosts. The Logical Switch as an object itself, is left alone, so the script doesnâ€™t touch it. You can modify the script according your needs of course.</p>

<p>And here is how you run the script:</p>

<pre>RemoveLogicalNetwork.ps1 -LogicalNetworkName "LNET_LAB_01" -whatif</pre>

<pre>RemoveLogicalNetwork.ps1 -LogicalNetworkName "LNET_LAB_01"</pre>
