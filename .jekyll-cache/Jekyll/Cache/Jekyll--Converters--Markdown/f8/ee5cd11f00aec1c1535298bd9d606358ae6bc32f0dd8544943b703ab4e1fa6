I"…<p>Some known and also a lot uf unknown faces I see here at PubForum. Because of Synergy weâ€™ll have a lot of Cirix people onsite, which will be a value add to the community I think.<br />
After a short keynote from Alex Jushin the sessions start with the session of Markus Klein and Oliver Lomberg from Citrix Systems<br />
