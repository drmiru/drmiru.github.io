I"l<p>Once upon a time there was a cool wrapper dll for accessing TS session info from scripts and .NET programs without accessing the complex and poorly documented WTS API. The dll was called WTSadmin.dll. Unfortunately this assembly does not work any more on 2008 R2 RDS. Googling and binging sent me to a project named <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cassia/" target="_blank">Cassia</a>, which is in fact another wrapper for the WTS API. And theeeeeere.. is a Powershell module using the Cassia wrapper. It can be downloaded <a href="http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/PSTerminalServices" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
