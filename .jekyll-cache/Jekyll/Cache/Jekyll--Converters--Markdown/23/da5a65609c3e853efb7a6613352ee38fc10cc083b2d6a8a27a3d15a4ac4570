I"E<p>Hyper-V with Server 2012 and SCVMM 2012 SP1 offer great network management and virtualization features. Even if the MS Technet documentation covering this is not bad at all, you might struggle trying to configure a converged fabric or network virtualization. This blog post just provides useful links to other blogs from fellow geeks and SMEs which will help you a lot to understand and configure virtual networks and switches. Personally I prefer the software defined networking approach using SCVMM, as it also shows the power of centralized definition and configuration.</p>
