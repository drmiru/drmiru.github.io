I"<p><span style="font-family: Calibri Light; font-size: 12pt;">Since December 24<sup>th</sup>, Azure Automation supports RBAC. We really asked Microsoft to implement this enhancement, as lots of sensitive information and code may live within an Azure Automation account. Assets are used to store credentials, variables, connection objects. As you might have more and more contributors to the system, you probably donâ€™t want to share all your credential objects to anyone writing automation runbooks. Before RBAC, the only way was to create multiple Automation accounts, but of course this introduced other difficulties.<br /> </span></p>
