I"5<p>Microsoft UEV could be called as “just another profile management solution”. I agree it’s a bit late for MS to publish the solution as there are vendors like Appsense or RES, which focus on user virtualization and user workspace management since many years with success. In the meantime UEV can be a value add for customers which think traditional roaming profile just suck, but don’t want/can spend a fortune for a high end solution… and… It’s included in MDOP 2012. For an overview about UEV I’d like to refer to a geek mate of mine, <a href="http://helgeklein.com/blog/2012/04/microsoft-user-experience-virtualization-ue-v-facts-and-review/">Helge Klein</a>.
