I"õ<p>In February 2014 I released a Service Management Automation white paper on TechNet. It became quite popular, so I decided to make this an ongoing project. I decided to release an update to the document at least 3 times a year. So my next editor round came along a request from <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandair" target="_blank">Aleksandar Nikolic</a>, the co-founder and editor of the famous <a href="http://www.powershellmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Powershell Magazine</a>. He also invested a fair amount of time to review my SMA white paper. A lot of useful and interesting comments where the result and along with other additions from myself, iâ€™ve put all together into a version 1.04. The most recent version is <a title="Service Management Automation (SMA) white paper" href="http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Service-Management-fcd75828" target="_blank">available by now on TechNet Gallery.</a></p>

<p>The most important changes / additions in a nutshell</p>

<ul>
  <li>Typo and PowerShell code corrections</li>
  <li>Additional info on debugging / logging best practice</li>
  <li>Workflow checkpoints</li>
  <li>Code font / layout changed for better copy/paste support</li>
  <li>Info on how to completely author SMA Runbooks in Powershell_ISE</li>
</ul>

<p>From the feedbacks I got from readers and automation folks, the white paper is good for beginners, as well as for SC Orchestrator and PowerShell cracks willing to start the transition to SMA.</p>

<p>Keep calm and automate!</p>
