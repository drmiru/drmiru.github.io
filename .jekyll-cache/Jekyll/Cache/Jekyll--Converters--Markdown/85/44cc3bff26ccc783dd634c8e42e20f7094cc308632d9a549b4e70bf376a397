I"a<p>While preparing my Demo Environment for the next TechNet Event, in fact re-bulding it with Technical Preview 4, I stumbled over an error while configuring the Cloud Witness for the storage clusters. Cloud Witness is a new feature of Server 2016. To have a Quorum for your clusters you can now leverage a file share resource on your Azure Storage Account.
