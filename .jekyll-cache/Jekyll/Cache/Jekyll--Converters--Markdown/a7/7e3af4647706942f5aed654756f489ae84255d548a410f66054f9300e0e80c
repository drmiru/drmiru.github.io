<p><strong>Session #1 Authentication on Citrix level by Lalit Kaushal</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic about Kerberos authentication process on XenApp and XenDesktop and the involved components<br />
KDC, TGS, TGT</li>
  <li>Passthrough Session (passing the user credential from one session to another)</li>
  <li>Passthrough Authentication (SSONSVR or Kerberos Ticket</li>
  <li>Smart Card Authentication<br />
– PNAgent always asks for PIN, some CSP like ActiveIdentiy provide PIN Caching<br />
– CDM driver module includes smart card redirection which all runs in usermode<br />
– scardhook.dll captures SC auth., forwards it to CtxSmartCardSvc, then to VC user moder API (PICA)<br />
– 4 new services on behavior of Smart Card on XenApp 6 / XenDesktop</li>
</ul>

<p>Because we have several issues in our company regarding Smart Card Authentication to XenDesktop / XenApp I take a note of the Kerberos-combination. This could also be solution to simplify the Authentication process in our XE environment. (Logon locally wih SC, then go further via Keberos on WI to the VDA.</p>

<p>great overview session about debugging techniques. Thanks Lalit!</p>

<p><strong>Session #3 Streaming / Application Delivery by Jesus Gonzales</strong> Some improvements to App Streaming 5.2 / 6</p>

<ul>
  <li>Isolation of Windows Services (RadeHlprService.exe controls the creation / deletion start and stop of isolated services (6.x)</li>
  <li>Sandbox Reuse –&gt; Profile (bubble) sharing of different application started (Since 5.2)</li>
  <li>No more CAB file in Version 6.0. It’s now a folder structure (This doesn’t look like a magic change, but there are some plans that citrix wants to mount a remote disk instead of streaming files down)</li>
</ul>

<p>So last session for this forum, just trying to catch the plane now and looking forward to Pubforum in Dublin 2011.<br />
Great Forum!! Thanx everyone!</p>
