I"ž<p>How to create a App-V package that fits different environments and location based configurations? Well there are several ways to achieve that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scripting inside the OSD file by adding registry keys and values as well as environment variables. (but what about file editing / replacement?)</li>
  <li>Creating a dedicated OSD file for each location / adaption of the package (but what about the package project not recognizing manual changes?)</li>
  <li>Create a dedicated package for each use case / location (well if you have a boreout, that could save your live but not the customerâ€™s money)</li>
</ul>

<p>The best solution IMHO is to outsource the logic to a script which interprets a simple XML file. So hereâ€™s the way to get there.</p>

<p>Within the OSD file you just add a script (of course a Powershell one, what else?) to be called at the PRE-LAUNCH state of an App-V application launch. The script reads out an XML file and executes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Registry mods</li>
  <li>Find / Replace within text based files (INI etc.)</li>
  <li>Copy files / folders</li>
</ul>

<p>Download the solution <a href="http://www.miru.ch/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/AppConf.zip" target="_blank">here</a> (it includes a little readme which should help you to implement that. Itâ€™s a BETA folks, so please drop me an <a href="mailto:michael@miru.ch" target="_blank">email</a> if you find bugs or have feature requests.</p>
