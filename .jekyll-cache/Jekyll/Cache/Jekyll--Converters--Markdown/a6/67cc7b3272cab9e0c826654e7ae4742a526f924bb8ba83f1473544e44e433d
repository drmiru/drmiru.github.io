I"X<p>Currently Iâ€™m working alot on SMA (Service Management Automation) and the transitions from SC Orchestrator. One big advantage SC Orchestrator still has, is the visualization, especially when following the best practice. Runbooks should not contain too many activities and should be generalized wherever possible. This keeps the Runbooks clean and reusable. So how can you nest Runbooks in SMA?<br />
Generally this is explained in <a title="SMA Whitepaper" href="http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Service-Management-fcd75828" target="_blank">my SMA Whitepaper on the TechNet Gallery</a>.</p>
