I"Ï	<p>While preparing my Demo Environment for the next TechNet Event, in fact re-bulding it with Technical Preview 4, I stumbled over an error while configuring the Cloud Witness for the storage clusters. Cloud Witness is a new feature of Server 2016. To have a Quorum for your clusters you can now leverage a file share resource on your Azure Storage Account. See <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/clustering/archive/2014/11/14/10572766.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> for more information about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/clustering/archive/2014/11/14/10572766.aspx" target="_blank">Cloud Witness</a>.</p>

<p>However, I have configured this functionality now quite a few times, but this time I got the following error:</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Set-ClusterQuorum : Server failed to authenticate the request. Make sure the value of Authorization header is formed correctly including the</span><br />
 <span style="color: #ff0000;">signature.</span><br />

<p>The reason for this error to occur is so simple, that I really thought if it is worth to create a post, but on the other hand it could help people to save time while digging in the wrong corner.</p>

<p>The root cause of this was a time sync issue between my Cluster nodes and Azure. In other words, I messed up with NTP configuration on my Lab Domain Controller. After I fixed the timing, the command run as expected.</p>

<pre>Set-ClusterQuorum -ClusterÂ yourcluster -CloudWitness -AccountNameÂ yourstorageaccount -AccessKey YouWontgetmyKeyHereofCourse:-)=='</pre>

<p>Inaccurate time settings can lead to other errors interacting with your Azure Storage Account as well, as it does with your on-premises services using Kerberos of course.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
