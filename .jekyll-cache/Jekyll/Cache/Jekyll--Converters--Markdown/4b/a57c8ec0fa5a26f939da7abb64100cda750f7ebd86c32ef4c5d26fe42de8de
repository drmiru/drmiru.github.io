I"D<p>Automating the world of datacenters and infrastructures has always been one of my passions. Starting with Service Management Automation (SMA), the capabilities have been extended in very cool ways. While still, SC Orchestrator is used heavily to automate IT processes, SMA is IMHO the little twinkle star. Released as a Version 1.0 together with Windows Azure Pack last year, the way Microsoft goes with automation in SMA has significantly changed the game. SMA is purely based on PowerShell Workflows. This brings some great enhancements like direct interoperability with DSC (Desired State Configuraton). PowerShell Workflows are rock solid, do support checkpoints and can be re-used even outside of SMA. Of course there are also some things you might miss in the current version of SMA when you compare it to SC Orchestrator.</p>
