I"-<p>Yesterday was an exciting day as I received the confirmation email from Microsoft for my first <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/award-value.aspx" target="_blank">MVP Award</a>. I’m proud now being part of this worldwide experts community. I was awarded with MVP for Cloud and Datacenter Management, which is a group of ~80 experts around the world. This not only shows that Microsoft is recognizing my work for the community over the last years, it also shows that these efforts together with the support of my fellow geeks, friends and co-workers have pushed me a huge step forward. I’m really looking forward to the <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp-global-summit.aspx" target="_blank">MVP Global Summit</a>, kicking of in Redmond this November. I’ll meet a lot of fellow MVPs and Program Managers in person. Lots of them I’m knowing “only” from Twitter or Email. This award motivates me to continue working with and for the community, to share knowledge and experience, and to inspire more people building Microsoft based clouds.</p>
