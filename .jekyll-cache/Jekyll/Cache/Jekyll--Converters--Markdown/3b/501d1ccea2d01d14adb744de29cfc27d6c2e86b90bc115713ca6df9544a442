<p><strong>Session #1 (Jim Moyle and Andrew Wood about ‚ÄúNirvana Phone‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>Using a single device for every computing and communication with a hypervisor. A nice discussion about having a primary computing device for everything. The basic idea behind is that you have a single, portable small form factor device with multiple OS on it and a lot of connectivity and add on stuff, like plugin in into a netbook device, a large screen device, etc.</p>
