I"<p>Even this happens very rarely on a Hyper-V host ğŸ˜‰ , Â it might still be useful under some circumstances to kill a hung or stucked VM. Most of the times the hung situation is caused by a guest shutdown request which does not get completed successfully. The GUI doesnâ€™t provide you a solution here (neither SCVMM, Hyper-V Manager or Failover Cluster Manager). Good old Powershell will solve it for you.</p>
