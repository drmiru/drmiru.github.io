I"Ô<p>Just coming back from a strange troubleshooting session where an application running on an AKS Cluster was not responding anymore after a network architecture change. It turned out quickly, that the root cause had to be searched in the recent configuration change. The change included a new routing configuration in the customers Azure global network. The AKS cluster‚Äôs network has been peered with a new hub network. The hub network is located in SwitzerlandNorth region whereas the AKS application vnet is located in WestEurope. So we have created a so called cross-region or ‚Äúglobal‚Äù vnet peering. <figure class="wp-block-image"></figure></p>

<p>After changing the routes everything but the AKS‚Äôs load balancer frontend IP was reachable from on-premises.</p>

<p>Long story short ‚Äì The AKS cluster was using the basic SKU of Azure Load Balancer which does not support global vNet peering.</p>

<p>Hope this prevents some headaches</p>

<p>Happy peering everyone!</p>
