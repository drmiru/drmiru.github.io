I":<p>Trying to install Exchange 2010 SP1 on 2008 R2 was not that easy as I thought. Everything but the CAS role could be installed.<br />
After installing latest windows patches setup asked always for two additional hotfixes while checking prerequisites for CAS role. Google and MS KB showed up weird results..</p>

<p>But to keep it short.. here’s the solution.</p>

<p>Windows Server 2008 R2 needs the following hotfixes : 979744, 983440, 979099 and 982867. Some of them are currently limited to Windows 7.  But as Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 share a lot of code so they do for hotfixes. Just Download them, install them, reboot your server and your done!</p>
