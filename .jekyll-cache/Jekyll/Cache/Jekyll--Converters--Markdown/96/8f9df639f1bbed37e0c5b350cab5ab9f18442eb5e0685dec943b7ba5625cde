I"i<p>I’ve published a new version of <a href="http://www.miru.ch/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Globalfunctions.zip" target="_blank">Globalfunctions.ps1</a> Powershell script, which includes a lot of userful functions for your daily PS scripting life.</p>

<p>To use the functions just “DOT source” the script in your original script:<br />
. <somepathto>\Globalfunctions.ps1</somepathto></p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Disclaimer:<br />
You are using the script and it’s functions at your own risk. The functions have been tested, but there is no warranty that they will work in every environment and constellation</p>
