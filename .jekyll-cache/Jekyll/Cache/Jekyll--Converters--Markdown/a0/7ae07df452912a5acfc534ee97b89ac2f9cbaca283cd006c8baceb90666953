I"a<p>I’ve been using terraform for Azure IaC in various customer projects the last months. One thing which is really critical is to have a proper terraform backend configuration. As long as you’re the only one working with a specific terraform configuration you only have to care about your own state file. But for production environments, where deployments are usually triggered by a CI/CD pipeline, you’re no longer handling with local state files and have to store them on a cloud storage. For Azure, it’s obviously an Azure Storage Account where you put your state file inside a blob container.</p>
