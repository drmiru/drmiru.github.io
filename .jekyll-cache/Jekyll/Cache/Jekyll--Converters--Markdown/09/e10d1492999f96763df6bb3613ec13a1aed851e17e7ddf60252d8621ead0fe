I"É<p>Due to an administrative action, restore or rebuild of the vCenter database,Â  assignments between the hypervisor connection from DDCâ€™s pool management service and the vSphere vCenter might be lost. The XenDesktop PoolManagementService manages the assignment by adding a special annotation attribute to each VM which has been added to a pool. The attribute name is CTXGuestOSId where the value represents the SID of the VMâ€™s AD computer account.</p>
