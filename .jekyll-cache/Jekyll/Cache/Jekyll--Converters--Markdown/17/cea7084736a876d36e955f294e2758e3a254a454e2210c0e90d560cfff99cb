I"‘<p>At some point in time every SDN deployment hits itâ€™s scale limit. In Microsofts SDNv1, a single NVGRE gateway can serve up to 100 tenant virtual networks and 200-300Mbit/s throughput. To scale out the network virtualization deployment, additional gateways or gateway clusters have to be deployed.Â But how canÂ we migrate existing virtualizedÂ tenant VM networks from one gateway to another?</p>
