I"X<p>As I read these bad news I thought about like many other geeks, how to find the right words for a tribute to Laura. I can’t say better than Chris Marks, that Laura’s contribution and her spirit inspired me to be a Citrix geek even in hard times when Citrix product versions 1.0 sucked. She is one of a few persons in the world, which you can’t easily replace with just another. I’m not sure who lost more by this move, the community or Citrix. At the end both will miss the charming, geeky girl pushing the community to be the most active and respected in the vendor’s world.We will miss her so much and I hope that wherever she moves to, we’ll be able to enjoy her charisma again.</p>

<p>Good luck Laura…</p>
