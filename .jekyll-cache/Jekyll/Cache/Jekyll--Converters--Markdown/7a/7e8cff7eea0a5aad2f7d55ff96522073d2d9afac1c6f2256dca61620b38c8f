I"Ñ<p>After recently updating a customerâ€™s HP Blade environment to the current firmware release, Hyper-V baremetal deployment stopped working. The environment is managed via <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/ch/de/enterprise/servers/products/infrastructure-management/index.aspx#.VP3wIE0mNps" target="_blank">HP OneView</a>. <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/ch/de/enterprise/servers/products/infrastructure-management/index.aspx#.VP3wIE0mNps" target="_blank">HP OneView</a> is a linux based, virtual appliance for central management of HP components, such as servers, blade chassis, interconnect flex modules, etc. An important thing to know is that fact that the servers will get an additonal, virtual SMBIOSGUID, as soon as they get under control of <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/ch/de/enterprise/servers/products/infrastructure-management/index.aspx#.VP3wIE0mNps" target="_blank">HP OneView</a>. And these are the issues I had, after the FW upgrade thru OneView.</p>
