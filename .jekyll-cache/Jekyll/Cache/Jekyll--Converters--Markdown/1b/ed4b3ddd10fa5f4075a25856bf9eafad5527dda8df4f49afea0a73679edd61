I"¸<p>A run in a very special issue when I tried to pass arguments to a powershell script if one of the arguments contained single quotes within the argument string like â€œthis is damn â€˜quoteâ€™ inside the arg!!â€ Your powershell script would then think that these are separated arguments. You wonâ€™t get the hell out of this sh*t. One possible solution is to place the â€œwrackyâ€ argument at the end, in fact use is as last argument. Install the <a title="Powershell Community Extensions" href="http://pscx.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1615" target="_blank">Powershell Community Extensions </a>and use the <strong>join-string</strong> cmdlet. Hereâ€™s an example.</p>
