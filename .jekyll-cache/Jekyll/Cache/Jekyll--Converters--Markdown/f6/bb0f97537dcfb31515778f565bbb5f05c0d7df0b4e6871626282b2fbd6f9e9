I"§<p>I recently came along some issues while trying to import previously exported or copied virtual machines for a customer. The recent admin did not document what he tried to do so far, but several of the virtual machines where in a likely â€œinconsistentâ€ state. Importing those VMs using the Hyper-V Manager GUI or Powershell CMDLETS failed with different errors, but all pointed to the same root causes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>VM has been exported from a recent hardware with CPUs of different Generation</li>
  <li>VM has been copied manually while being in a saved state</li>
  <li>VM has been copied manually, while mixing up config files and snapshots from different VMs (donâ€™t ask me how this can happen, apparently with enough beer before going to work??)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following steps show how to get rid of most compatibility issues.</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p><strong>1. Create a compatibility report</strong></p>

<pre>$report = compare-VM -Path 'C:\ClusterStorage\Volume1\CMIRUW702\VirtualMachines\CF91993E-B76B-4D0D-ADFD-4D4DEDACE5A4.XML'</pre>

<p><strong>2. Show all incompatibilities</strong></p>

<pre>$report | ft -auto</pre>

<p><strong>3. Show first incompatibility</strong></p>

<pre>$report.Incompatibilities[0].Source</pre>

<p>You should get an output showing you the root cause for incompatibilities</p>

<p><em>VMName Name SnapshotType CreationTime ParentSnapshotName</em><br />
<em>â€”â€” â€”- â€”â€”â€”â€” â€”â€”â€”â€” â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</em><br />
<em>CMIRUW702 DEMO Clean Planned 24.11.2012 01:13:51</em></p>

<p><strong>4. Fix the incompatibility (in this case, remove the snapshot)</strong></p>

<pre>$report.Incompatibilities[0].Source | Remove-VMSavedState</pre>

<p><strong>5. Import the VM using the modified report data</strong></p>

<pre>import-vm -CompatibilityReport $report</pre>

<p>Â </p>

<p>Being aware that there are also error situations which canâ€™t be fixed the steps above should help to save time and nervs.</p>
