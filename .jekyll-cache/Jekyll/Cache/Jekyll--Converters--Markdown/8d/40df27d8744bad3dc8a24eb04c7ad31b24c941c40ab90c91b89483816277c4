I"š<p>In February 2014 I released a Service Management Automation white paper on TechNet. It became quite popular, so I decided to make this an ongoing project. I decided to release an update to the document at least 3 times a year. So my next editor round came along a request from <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandair" target="_blank">Aleksandar Nikolic</a>, the co-founder and editor of the famous <a href="http://www.powershellmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Powershell Magazine</a>. He also invested a fair amount of time to review my SMA white paper. A lot of useful and interesting comments where the result and along with other additions from myself, iâ€™ve put all together into a version 1.04. The most recent version is <a title="Service Management Automation (SMA) white paper" href="http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Service-Management-fcd75828" target="_blank">available by now on TechNet Gallery.</a></p>
