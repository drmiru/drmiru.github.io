The traditional Windows BSOD has turned into a rarely occuring phenomen, sometimes you might see still see it. Didn&#8217;t you crossed your hands over your head and thought&#8230; What the f\*** shall I do with this information on the bluescreen?  
I&#8217;ve collected some useful links which will help you to get a knowledge of analyzing crash dumps (system and application crashes). Finally it shows you which component was responsible to crash your system / application.  
An important note here:  
MOST of user executed applications can&#8217;t be responsible for a system crash cause they are executed in the user mode of the operating system memory. So mainly kernel mode sw/hw drivers are causing your winbox to show a BSOD. Instead of asking your users, &#8220;which application did you start before it crashed?&#8221; you better have a look into the following pages and make yourself fit in basics of crash dump analysis. A special thank here to Mark Russinovich, Dmitri Vostokov and Lalit Kaushal for sharing their tremendous knowledge about this stuff.
