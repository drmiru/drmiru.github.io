I got the confirmation that I will present again @ E2EVC in Copenhagen, this time together with MVP [Thomas Maurer](http://www.thomasmaurer.ch) about System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 SP1 .

<span style="color: #333399;"><em>&#8220;<strong>E2EVC Virtualisation Conference</strong> is a non-commercial, virtualisation community Event. </em></span>  
<span style="color: #333399;"><em>The main goal is to bring the best virtualisation experts together to exchange knowledge and to establish new connections. E2EVC is a weekend crammed with presentations, Master Classes and discussions delivered by both virtualisation vendors product teams and independent experts&#8221;</em></span>

There are still a few tickets left for this great event, fully loaded with high level technical content.

Grab a seat!
