**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&#8217;s new in VMware vSphere 4 @ Magirus &#8211; Day 2</span>**

Again I&#8217;m outlining my personal impressions of this update course&#8217;s 2nd day.

  * &#8211; Networking (continued)  
    &#8211;> PWLAN support (enables private vlans, promiscuous / isolated / community) to separate VMs lying on the same vlan. In fact a vlan can be split up again into different PWLANs.
  * &#8211; Nondisruptive Migration to Distributed Virtual Switches  
    &#8211;> Create new distributed switch, define uplinks, add first adapter to uplink, define port groups, remap VMs to new Port Groups (wizard driven), add second adapters to uplinks
  * &#8211; Storage Management  
    &#8211;> Pluggable Storage Architecture allows 3rd Party Modules for failover / multipathing  
    &#8211;> iSCSI enhancements (bidirectional CHAP, reduced CPU overhead for swiSCSI, per target CHAP, swiSCSI no longer required Service Console  
    &#8211;> HBA Round Robin Multipathing is no more just experimental ðŸ™‚  
    &#8211;> Enhanced storage reporting, monitoring and alerting / triggering  
    &#8211;> Thin provisioning now within GUI (thin provisioning does not support fault tolerance!)  
    &#8211;> VMFS Â dynamic grow (if storage supports that)  
    &#8211;> Storage VMOTION supports change of provisioning mode when changing the Datastore (thick <> thin). Â SVMOTION now in GUI together with VMOTION (Migrate). SVMOTION works now without using snapshots. (creates a destination disks, copies content ->change block tracking ->, Â fast suspend/resume to switch to destination disk. SVMOTION works now with independent disks too (at least in the lab I saw it working)  
    &#8211;> Replica Management (Resignaturing) is now Datastore based (admin can choose to use the existing label for mirror LUNs)
  * HA  
    &#8211;> Host Monitoring can be disabled (useful for maintenance on hosts or network infrastructure to prevent disrupts or side effects)  
    &#8211;> Specific Failoverhost can be configured  
    &#8211;> Percentage or Number value can be assigned to failover policy  
    &#8211;> VM Monitoring (checks vmware tools heartbeat). If a VM stucks in bluescreen, it gets restarted if configured so.
  * Fault Tolerance  
    &#8211;> adds a secondary VM on another node (copies via vLockstep the whole state to the secondary VM)  
    &#8211;> a lot of requirements and limitations make this technology not useful for a lot of use cases (1vCPU, no snaps, no paravirtualized guests, etc, etc.)  
    &#8211;> requires dedicated vmknics on vmkernel PG)  
    &#8211;> requires SSL verification enabled on vCenter! This means every host incl. vCenter must have a valid and trusted cert installed!!

Saw today that RVTOOLS (<http://www.robware.net/>). Â RVTools is a small .NET 2.0 application which uses the VI SDK to display information about your virtual machines. Very useful.

A must is the following website:Â <http://vsphere-land.com/>
