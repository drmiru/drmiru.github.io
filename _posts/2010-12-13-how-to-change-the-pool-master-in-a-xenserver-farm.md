First you have to disable HA on the pool

**#xe pool-ha-disable**

List the hosts in the pool

**#xe host-list**

Promote the new slave

**\# xe pool-designate-new-master host-uuid=<type the uuid of the new master>**

> If the pool master is not available the switch has to be enforced to succeed.

 **#xe pool-emergency-transition-to-master**

re-establish connectio to the slave hosts

 **#xe pool-recover-slave**

You&#8217;re done!
