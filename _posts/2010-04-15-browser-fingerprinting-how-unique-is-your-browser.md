Many people are asking: &#8220;how in the world they know that&#8217;s me returning to their website?&#8221; Well.. the most known reason is that the website stores a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">cookie</a> on your local harddrive.

The most unknown reason is that they captured a fimgerprint by gathering information about your browser environment. A common way to achieve this is using java script. The website <a href="http://panopticlick.eff.org" target="_blank">http://panopticlick.eff.org</a> shows an online experiment how information of your browser can be used to create a unique fingerprint. Just try it out and stare at your screen. It&#8217;s amazing how few information is required to identify you using your browser&#8217;s interfaces. Additionally the tiping speed on your keyboard is also an information that can be gathered by a java script. Imagine how these methods can be used by companies and criminal organisations to personalize each www user.
