**Session #1 (Jim Moyle and Andrew Wood about &#8220;Nirvana Phone&#8221;**

Using a single device for every computing and communication with a hypervisor. A nice discussion about having a primary computing device for everything. The basic idea behind is that you have a single, portable small form factor device with multiple OS on it and a lot of connectivity and add on stuff, like plugin in into a netbook device, a large screen device, etc.

**Session #2 (Simon Frost about the Consumerazation of IT)**

BYOC, today employees are excpected to be more flexible, IT has to support that. So where are the pain points?

  * Data Loss Prevention
  * Malware / Virus outbrakes
  * IT has to support &#8220;unknown&#8221; devices which may be in a horrible state
  * Tablets & Smartphones are hard to manage, because they aren&#8217;t designed for beeing managed

Whynot providing enterprise app stores to gain flexibility for users while staying within bounds of IT / Security?

**Session # 3 (Shawn Bass about &#8220;Making Sense of Desktop Virtualization&#8221;)**

What is Desktop virtualization about? what do companies try to achieve by implementing desktop virtualization?

  * Hardware abstraction
  * Loosley coupled OS, Applications, Data, Settings
  * Mobility
  * Faster Provisioning
  * Rapid Desktop DR
  * Effectively manage branch infrastructure
  * Optimize OS Migrations
  * Reducing costs for application delivery, shorten time to market
  * Support work from hom initatives

Again a lightening fast speaking Shawn Bass with great content.

**Session #4 VMware Ireland about.**.

Agility, Costs, Security Concerns, Consumerisation of IT. A pretty cool walk around covering products and initiatives from VMware

**Session #5 Aidan Finn about Microsoft Private Clond Computing**

SCVMM 2012 (new from the ground)

  * Manage 3rd party hypervisors (vSphere, Xenserver)
  * Bare metal Hyper-V deployment, Patch management
  * Dynamic Optimzation (like VMware has its DRS)
  * Power Optimization
  * PRO (Integrate with SCOM to respond on application-level performance monitor

Project Concero

  * A Web portal to integrate public cloud (Azzure) with private cloud (SCVMM)

Last session of today (I&#8217;ve visited) was Profile Migrator Demo from Helge Klein. A pretty cool tool which helps admins out of the common &#8220;where are my settings&#8221; hell while doing client migrations.
