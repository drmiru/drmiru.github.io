In a recent <a href="http://www.miru.ch/why-i-think-azure-pack-isnt-just-for-service-providers/" target="_blank">blog post</a> I wrote about the importance of Windows Azure Pack and Service Management Automation and why I think, Windows Azure Pack isn&#8217;t just for Service Providers. I&#8217;m glad to release a whitepaper today, giving guidlines to deploy and manage SMA.

So what can you ecpect from reading this whitepaper?

  * Concepts and architecture of System Center 2012 R2 Service Management Automation
  * Prerequisites to deploy SMA in your organization
  * Installing and configuring the various SMA components
  * Basics on PowerShell workflow scripting
  * Creating and authoring SMA runbooks
  * Linking runbooks to SPF / VM Cloud action events
  * Interoperability with System Center Orchestrator Runbooks
  * Converting Orchestrator runbooks to SMA
  * Scaling an SMA infrastructure
  * Extending SMA with custom modules

Additionally you’ll find a collection of useful links on SMA, PowerShell workflow concepts and Windows Azure Pack.

Special thanks go to Michel Lüscher and Kristian Nese for their time invested to review the whitepaper.

I hope this document can help you with a fire start on Service Management Automation.

Happy reading!
