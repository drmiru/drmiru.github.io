# What is WAP Console Connect?

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">WAP Remote Console Connect <span style="color: #1c1c1c;">allows tenants to connect to their virtuals machine through a SSL-tunnelled RDP connection regardless of the virtual machine having an IP address or Remote Desktop connectivity enabled.</span> The good thing here, it also works for Linux based VMs in the same way. The &#8220;bad&#8221; thing, the connection, even when RDP based, doesn&#8217;t allow client interactions like clip board, local drives, smart cards, etc. I&#8217;m not sure if this is be design for security reasons. However, when connecting via Internet, a dedicated Remote Desktop Gateway is required, as the RD Gateway gets a special &#8220;claim based authentication&#8221;-configuration making it unusable for other purposes like Remote Desktop Sessions or Remote Apps.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>This post&#8217;s intend is to highlight the most common mistakes when implementing Windows Azure Pack Console Connect feature</strong>.<br /> I&#8217;m not going in detail through the installation and configuration procedure, as this is documented in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn469415.aspx" target="_blank">this TechNet Article</a>.<br /> </span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;">To give you a basic understanding, I pasted the original Microsoft big picture here.<br /> </span>

## How it works &#8220;in a nutshell&#8221;

While it is a bit more complex in detail, I tried to simplify the process for a short overview.

  * User connects to Tenant Portal and selects a virtual machine to connect to its remote console (not RDP)
  * Azure Pack connects via Service Provider Foundation to SCVMM and asks for an access token
  * SCVMM knows the Hyper-V Host, the VM is currently running on and creates a claim token using the private key of the installed VMM Gateway Certificate
  * The token together with a dynamic issued RDP file are returned to Azure Pack Tenant Portal and user is asked if he wants to open the signed RDP file
  * RDP Connection is established via RD Gateway to the Hyper-V Host, the VM currently runs on
  * The Hyper-V Host verifies the claim token using the public key of the VMM Gateway Certificate and grants access to the VM Remote Console

&nbsp;

## These are the basic requirements to get this thing up and running.

  * A valid SSL Certificate on SCVMM host with &#8220;Client Authentication&#8221; as enhanced key usage. If as self-signed certificate is used, it must also to be present on each Hyper-V Host (Local Machine Cert Store)
  * A valid SSL Certificate on the RD Gateway host with &#8220;Server Authentication&#8221; as enhanced key usage
  * Remote Console Connect configuration on SCVMM host
  * Federated Authentication Gateway component installed on the RD Gateway
  * Trusted certificate thumbprint set for RDP file signing on RD Gateway (the thumbprint of the certificate from Step 1)
  * RDP Client 8.1 on the endpoint. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2830477/en-us" target="_blank">See here for a Windows 7 version of RDP 8.1 Client</a>

## Most common deployment mistakes

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mistake 1:<br /> </strong></span>

  * A self-signed SSL certificate has been used on SCVMM to generate the access tokens, but the certificate has not been imported into the computers certificate store on each Hyper-V Host
  * A self-signed SSL certificate has been used on SCVMM to generate the access tokens, but the certificate&#8217;s public key has not been imported in the &#8220;Trusted Root Certificate Authorities&#8221; container on each Hyper-V Host  
    **<span style="color: red;">In both cases above, Your browser will get a JSON file containing a not very helpful error message, instead of receiving an RDP File when trying to connect a VM Console</span>  
** 

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mistake 2:<br /> </strong></span>

  * The certificate has been issued with an invalid cryptographic service provider type -> &#8220;Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider&#8221; is required.

<span style="color: red;"><strong>In this case the VMM Logs will display the following error:<br /> </strong></span>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;">
  SCVMM Version=3.2.7620.0<br /> SCVMM flavor=C-buddy-RTL-AMD64<br /> Default Assembly Version=3.2.7620.0<br /> Executable Name=vmmservice.exe<br /> Executable Version=3.2.7510.0<br /> Base Exception Target Site=140727707248024<br /> Base Exception Assembly name=mscorlib.dll<br /> Base Exception Method Name=<span style="color: red;"><strong>System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException.ThrowCryptographicException<br /> </strong></span>Exception Message=<span style="color: red;"><strong>Invalid algorithm specified</strong></span>.
</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mistake 3:<br /> </strong></span>

  * The thumbprint of the SSL certificate installed on SCVMM has not been registered on the RD Gateway host
  * The SSL Certificate for RD Gateway Host has been changed or renewed without restarting the host

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mistake 4:<br /> </strong></span>

  * The RD Gateway URL defined on the VM Cloud in WAP Portal does not match the CN of the RD Gateway Certficate.
  * The Certificate used for RD Gateway does not have DNS=<gatewayFQDN> set as a &#8220;Subject Alternative Name&#8221;
  * In this case you&#8217;ll see the following error message:

While there are other pitfalls like SSL-Offloading, Load-Balancing etc., I hope this post covers the most often occurring issues and questions I see around Windows Azure Pack Console Connect feature.
