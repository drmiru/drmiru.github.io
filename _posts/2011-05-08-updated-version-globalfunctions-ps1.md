I&#8217;ve published a new version of <a href="../images/2011/05/Globalfunctions.zip" target="_blank">Globalfunctions.ps1</a> Powershell script, which includes a lot of userful functions for your daily PS scripting life.

To use the functions just &#8220;DOT source&#8221; the script in your original script:  
. <somepathto>\Globalfunctions.ps1

Have fun!

Disclaimer:  
You are using the script and it&#8217;s functions at your own risk. The functions have been tested, but there is no warranty that they will work in every environment and constellation
