This simple but useful approach became very popular if I watch my blog hit stats. So here&#8217;s the final part for Hyper-V.

How to identify a virtual machine if you just know it&#8217;s MAC Address?

For SCVMM 2012 SP1

<pre>Get-SCVirtualNetworkAdapter -All | ? MACAddress -eq '00:50:56:AF:00:6D' | Select Name,MACAddress,VirtualNetWork</pre>

For Hyper-V Manager

<pre>Get-VM | Get-VMNetworkAdapter | ? MacAddress -eq '00155D640F05' | select VMName,MacAddress,IPAdd resses</pre>
