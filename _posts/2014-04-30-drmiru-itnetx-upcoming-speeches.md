## DRMIRU @ ITNETX

2014 is going to be a very special year for me. By the 1st of may I&#8217;ll join <a href="http://www.itnetx.ch/" target="_blank">itnetx GmbH</a>&#8216;s Cloud and Datacenter Management Team, as a Cloud Architect for Microsoft based Cloud and Datacenter Mananagement Solutions. I&#8217;m really excited to join the most powerful and knowleged company in Switzerland&#8217;s CDM field. Being part of a motivated and highly skilled team, I will continue to deliver consulting and implementation services for mid to large size customers, focused on Microsoft Cloud solutions.

## COMMUNITY WORK

In January and March I had the honour to present three times during a Microsoft TechNet Event. Two of the sessions where focused on Server 2012 R2 Storage enhancements, the third was about Windows Azure Pack and SMA.You can view the slide decks **on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/drmiru" target="_blank">slideshare here</a>.**

In February I released a <a href="http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Service-Management-fcd75828" target="_blank">White Paper about &#8220;Service Management Automation&#8221; in System Center 2012 R2</a>. At this point I&#8217;d like to thank all the readers which provided feedback and especially the two mates, who acted as reviewers, <a href="http://www.server-talk.eu" target="_blank">Michel LÃ¼scher</a> from Microsoft and <a href="http://kristiannese.blogspot.ch/" target="_blank">Kristian Nese</a> from Lumagate.

In May I will join once again the famous E2E Virtualization Conference. If you want to know more about E2EVC, have a look at **one of my recent posts <a href="http://www.miru.ch/why-im-consistently-returning-to-e2e-virtualization-conference/" target="_blank">here</a>**. This spring the conference will kick off in Brussels (Belgium) from 31th of May to 2nd of June. Together with my fellow geek and now co-worker as well, **<a href="http://www.thomasmaurer.ch/" target="_blank">MVP Thomas Maurer</a>**, I&#8217;ll have two sessions in a row on &#8220;how to create a Microsoft Private Cloud end-to-end&#8221;.

September will be the month of SCU (**<a href="http://www.systemcenteruniverse.ch/" target="_blank">System Center Universe Europe</a>**). SCU is a community driven knowledge exchange and networking event and a truly alternative to MMS, which has been retired by Microsoft. The second edition of this conference will take place in Basel / Switzerland from September 17th to 19th. I&#8217;m honoured to present there as well, beside tons of experts, fellow geeks and MVPs.

In November, as scheduled so far, I&#8217;ll join the second European E2E Virtualization Conference in 2014, kicking of in Barcelone / Spain.

So beside having interesting projects ahead of me, 2014 will also be a year for the community ðŸ˜‰

Cheers

Michael
