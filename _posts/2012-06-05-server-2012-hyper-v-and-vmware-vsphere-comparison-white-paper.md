Microsoft has released a white paper which compares <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/A/0/5A0AAE2E-EB20-4E20-829D-131A768717D2/Competitive%20Advantages%20of%20Windows%20Server%202012%20RC%20Hyper-V%20over%20VMware%20vSphere%205%200%20V1%200.pdf" target="_blank">features and capabilities between Hyper-V from Server 2012 and VMware&#8217;s vSphere 5</a>.

Taking into account that it&#8217;s a Microsoft paper, the independence is not real here of course. But thinking about a hypervisor delivering enterprise-class scalability and functionality at ZERO additional costs I&#8217;d say: Going for Hyper-V has never made more sense than with Server 2012. Stay tuned.
