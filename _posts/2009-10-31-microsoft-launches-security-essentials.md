Microsoft has launched it&#8217;s new PC security solution  &#8220;Security Essentials&#8221;, an all in one client protection suite, all free and after a first look at it &#8211; really not too bad. It protects from virues and malware.

Why use a third party tool if we can use this one?

Let&#8217;s try it out&#8230;
