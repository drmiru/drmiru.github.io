Pubforum is no more, it&#8217;s now called **E2E virtualization conference**. The most of us think that it&#8217;s a good change to gain a more professional touch also for the sponsors by this rebranding.

**Session # (Hyper-V Q+A)**

[Aidan Finn](http://www.aidanfinn.com/) open a 15min Q+A session about Hyper-V. He&#8217;s the man if you have any issues or design questions about Hyper-V deployments.

**Session #  ([Nicke Kallen](http://www.viridisit.se/eng/blog/) about App-V application virtualization)**

  * About BP around virtualizing applications
  * What should be installed in the base image / what not . He pinpoints that most of the redistributable should be in the base image (C, C#, F#, j# C++, .NET).
  * What does the improvements with Office 2010 and App-V really mean? 
      * Not much. There are still issues where it does not make really sense to virtualize Office on a fat client
      * Could be good for XenApp / VDI where you maintain a single image
  * Nicke shows a demo of 4.6 SP1 sequencer

A cool session at all. I&#8217;m glad to know that there is a guy out there who can help me out of difficulties while creating App-V Packages.

**Session # ([Daniel Wedel](http://www.wedel.no/) about Web Interface 5.4)**

A really cool overview about news and hints, as well as BPs. I&#8217;ll wait for the presentation to be available.

Later on, [Thomas Poppelgaard](http://www.poppelgaard.com/) and [Helmut Hauser](http://de.linkedin.com/pub/helmut-hauser/8/402/90) showed us HDX 3D experiences and what it can / can&#8217;t provide at the moment.

Last Session for today was about **IOPS**, by [Jim Moyle](http://www.jimmoyle.com/).

He pinpoints the pain in the  *ss topics around large scale VDI deployments, what IOPS is all about , how it can be measured and which methods can be used to be more flexible.

After all, now it&#8217;s time for some networking.
