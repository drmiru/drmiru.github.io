 Just coming back from a strange troubleshooting session where an application running on an AKS Cluster was not responding anymore after a network architecture change. It turned out quickly, that the root cause had to be searched in the recent configuration change. The change included a new routing configuration in the customers Azure global network. The AKS cluster&#8217;s network has been peered with a new hub network. The hub network is located in SwitzerlandNorth region whereas the AKS application vnet is located in WestEurope. So we have created a so called cross-region or &#8220;global&#8221; vnet peering. <figure class="wp-block-image">

After changing the routes everything but the AKS&#8217;s load balancer frontend IP was reachable from on-premises.

Long story short &#8211; The AKS cluster was using the basic SKU of Azure Load Balancer which does not support global vNet peering.

Hope this prevents some headaches

Happy peering everyone!
