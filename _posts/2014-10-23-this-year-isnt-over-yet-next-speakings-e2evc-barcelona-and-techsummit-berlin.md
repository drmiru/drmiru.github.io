This year has been a busy one already, but more to come up.

  * After speaking at various TechNet events in the beginning of the year, I spoke at <a href="http://www.e2evc.com/home/" target="_blank">E2EVC</a> this spring together with fellow Thomas Maurer on &#8220;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/drmiru/e2evc-2014-building-clouds-with-microsoft-cloud-os-and-system-center" target="_blank">How to create a Microsoft Private Cloud</a>&#8221; using the Cloud OS and the System Center solution stack.
  * During the winter season I wrote <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Service-Management-fcd75828" target="_blank">whitepaper on SMA</a>, covering the new automation flagship &#8220;Service Management Automation&#8221;. The <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Service-Management-fcd75828" target="_blank">pape</a>r has become a huge success, which I did not think of when I wrote it.
  * In May I joined <a href="http://www.itnetx.ch/" target="_blank"><strong>itnetx</strong></a>, a swiss SI for Microsoft Cloud and Workplace solutions and Microsoft Partner of the Year for past 3 years
  * In June I was invited to have a guest speach at the Austrian System Center User Group on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/drmiru/service-management-automation-sma-from-zero-to-hero" target="_blank">SMA &#8220;from zero to hero&#8221;</a>.
  * In July a was awarded as a Microsoft <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview.aspx" target="_blank">MVP for Cloud and Datacenter Management</a> (no need to explain what this means to me)
  * In September I was honored to present two session at <a href="http://www.systemcenteruniverse.ch/" target="_blank">System Center Universe Europe</a> in Basel (CH). One session on SMA together with fellow MVP Markus Klein , the other session on SDS / Storage Spaces together with fellow MVP Carsten Rachfahl.  You can watch the session on channel9.

### The next upcoming speaches are&#8230;

  * &#8220;Deep Dive into Microsoft&#8217;s Software defined Storage Stack&#8221; at <a href="http://www.e2evc.com/home/" target="_blank">E2eVC Barcelona</a> (24th &#8211; 26th October)
  * &#8220;Automation 2.0. A journey through the new set of tools around Microsoft datacenter- and hybrid-cloud automation&#8221; at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/germany/technical-summit/default.aspx" target="_blank">Technical Summit Berlin</a> (11th &#8211; 13th November)

The highlight of this year will be the <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/summit.aspx" target="_blank">MVP Summit</a> in November, kicking off at Microsoft HQ in Redmond. Around 1200 MVPs will meet, network and exchange information together with the Microsoft leads and PMs. I&#8217;m really looking forward to meet a lot of nice and skilled people in person.

Hope to see you on one of the upcoming events!
